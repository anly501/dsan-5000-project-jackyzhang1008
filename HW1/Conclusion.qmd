# Question and Answers

1.  What is nuclear energy?

    1.  Nuclear energy is energy released from the nucleus of atoms through processes like fission or fusion. Itâ€™s a powerful source of energy harnessed for electricity generation.

2.  Why are we using nuclear energy?

    1.  Nuclear energy is used because it's a potent source of electricity that can meet large-scale energy demands. It's also considered a low-carbon energy source, which is important in the context of climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

3.  Advantages of nuclear energy?

    1.  **High Energy Density:** Nuclear energy has a much higher energy density than fossil fuels. This means a small amount of nuclear fuel can produce a large amount of energy.

    2.  **Low Greenhouse Gas Emissions:** Nuclear plants do not emit carbon dioxide during operation, making them an attractive option for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

    3.  **Reliability:** Nuclear power plants operate continuously and are not subject to weather or climate conditions, unlike solar or wind energy.

4.  Disadvantages of nuclear energy?

    1.  **Radioactive Waste:** Managing radioactive waste, which remains hazardous for thousands of years, is a significant challenge.

    2.  **Nuclear Accidents:** Though rare, nuclear accidents like Chernobyl and Fukushima have long-lasting environmental and health impacts.

    3.  **High Costs:** The construction, operation, and decommissioning of nuclear power plants involve high costs.

5.  How to radioactive waste is managed?

    1.  Radioactive waste is managed through methods like deep geological storage, where waste is buried deep underground in stable geological formations. Reprocessing can also be used to recycle some spent fuel.

6.  Is nuclear energy safe?

    1.  Modern nuclear power plants are designed with multiple safety systems and are considered safe. However, the potential for severe accidents, though low, remains a concern.

7.  Problem with radiation?

    1.  Radiation can cause health problems like radiation sickness, increased cancer risk, and genetic damage. Therefore, controlling exposure to radiation, especially in nuclear power plants, is crucial.

8.  What is the difference between fission and fusion?

    1.  **Fission** is the splitting of a heavy nucleus into smaller nuclei, releasing energy. It's the process used in current nuclear power plants.

    2.  **Fusion** is the joining of two light atomic nuclei to form a heavier nucleus, releasing even more energy than fission. Fusion is seen as a promising future technology but is currently not commercially viable.

9.  How do nuclear power plant work?

    1.  Nuclear power plants use the heat generated from nuclear fission in a contained environment to produce steam, which then drives turbines to generate electricity.

10. What is the future for nuclear power?

    1.  The future of nuclear power includes the development of safer, more efficient technologies like Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) and the ongoing research into nuclear fusion. Additionally, there's a focus on improving waste management and addressing public concerns about safety and environmental impact.
