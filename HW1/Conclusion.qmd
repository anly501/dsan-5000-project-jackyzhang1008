## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Nuclear Energy Utilization Factor

1.  **Stable High Performance**: The majority of nuclear plants demonstrate high utilization factors, typically ranging between 90 to 100. This indicates a consistent and efficient performance in generating nuclear energy across most plants.

2.  **Symmetric Distribution with Variability**: The utilization factors across the years show a relatively symmetric distribution, indicating a balanced performance across nuclear plants. However, certain years exhibit greater variability, suggesting fluctuations in operational efficiency.

3.  **Positive Correlations**: The positive correlations between utilization factors across different years suggest that plants maintaining high performance in one year tend to replicate this performance in subsequent years. This pattern underscores the importance of consistent operational standards and practices.

4.  **Distinguished High and Low Performers**: Specific plants, such as Peach Bottom and Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, consistently outperform others with average utilization factors above 97. In contrast, plants like Grand Gulf and Fermi are identified as consistent low performers, indicating potential areas for operational improvements or investigations.

5.  **Performance Tiers**: The categorization into performance tiers provides a clear stratification of plants based on efficiency levels. It highlights the plants that are excelling and those that might require more attention or resources to enhance their performance.

6.  **Identification of Outliers**: The analysis successfully identifies outliers for each year, indicating plants that significantly deviate from the average performance. Repeated appearance of certain plants as outliers, such as Grand Gulf and Fermi, suggests persistent issues that may need targeted intervention.

## Naive Bayes

### Nuclear Energy Utilization Factor Prediction:

-   **Handling Outliers**: The preprocessing step included capping the utilization factors at 100% to ensure the data falls within a realistic range. This approach reflects real-world scenarios where utilization might occasionally exceed 100%.

-   **Feature Selection and Categorization**: The mean utilization factor from 2013 to 2021 was used as a feature to predict the utilization category for 2022. Utilization factors were categorized as 'High' (≥ 90%) or 'Low' (\< 90%), simplifying the classification task.

-   **Model Performance**:

    -   The Gaussian Naïve Bayes model achieved an 80% accuracy, indicating a good level of predictive capability.

    -   The model performed better in predicting the 'High' utilization category, as evidenced by higher precision, recall, and F1-scores.

    -   The confusion matrix indicated a balanced number of false positives and negatives, suggesting that the model does not excessively favor one class over the other.

-   **Insights and Recommendations**:

    -   Given the model's relatively high accuracy, it can be a valuable tool for preliminary assessments of plant performance.

    -   The model could be improved by incorporating more features or exploring other variants of Naïve Bayes.

    -   This approach can aid in resource allocation, maintenance scheduling, and operational planning for nuclear plants.

    -   This method can be extended to other domains where keyword-based classification is applicable.

## Decision Tree

### Random Forest Classifier:

-   The Random Forest model, known for its robustness and ability to handle complex datasets, displayed exceptional performance with near-perfect precision, recall, and F1-scores across all categories.

-   This high level of accuracy suggests that the model effectively captured the patterns and relationships in the data, providing reliable predictions.

-   However, the perfect accuracy might also raise questions about overfitting, the complexity of the model, or the distinctiveness of the dataset features.

### Decision Tree Classifier:

-   The Decision Tree model also showed perfect performance metrics, which is unusual in practical scenarios.

-   Decision Trees are simpler and more interpretable compared to Random Forests, but they are generally more prone to overfitting.

-   The visualization of the Decision Tree provides valuable insights into how the model makes decisions, offering a clear and intuitive understanding of the underlying process.

## Reduction

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA):

-   PCA was effective in reducing the dimensions of the dataset while preserving most of the variance. The cumulative explained variance plot showed a flattening curve, suggesting that a substantial amount of information can be captured with a relatively small number of components.

-   The scatter plot of the first two principal components provided a high-level overview of the data's structure. However, as PCA prioritizes variance, it may miss some of the subtler, non-linear relationships present in the data.

### t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE):

-   t-SNE provided a more nuanced view of the dataset, particularly in capturing local structures and relationships. By varying the perplexity parameter, different aspects of the data were emphasized.

-   The plots with different perplexity values highlighted the importance of this parameter in t-SNE. Lower perplexity focused more on local structures, while a higher perplexity provided a more global view of the data. However, too high or too low a perplexity can lead to misleading representations.

## Clustering

### K-Means Clustering:

-   **Elbow Method**: The Elbow method provided a visual means to estimate the optimal number of clusters. The plot suggested a leveling off around 20-30 clusters, which is indicative of a point beyond which adding more clusters doesn't significantly improve the model.

-   **Silhouette Scores**: The Silhouette analysis was used to validate the consistency within clusters. It showed how the data is grouped into clusters and the separation between them, offering a quantifiable measure to determine the optimal number of clusters.

-   **Implementation and Results**: Implementing K-Means with 3 clusters based on the standard scaled data provided a clear categorization of the dose rates into distinct groups, reflecting differing levels of radiation exposure.

### DBSCAN Clustering:

-   **Epsilon Variation Analysis**: By varying the epsilon parameter, DBSCAN's sensitivity to the density of the dataset was explored. The optimal epsilon value was found to be around 1.0, providing a balance between cluster formation and noise recognition.

-   **Noise Handling and Cluster Formation**: DBSCAN effectively identified core points and outliers, distinguishing between high-density areas and sparse regions. This characteristic made DBSCAN particularly useful for datasets with noise or anomalies.

### Hierarchical Clustering:

-   **Dendrogram Visualization**: The dendrogram provided a visual representation of the data aggregation process, illustrating how individual elements are grouped into clusters.

-   **Agglomerative Approach**: Using an agglomerative method, the hierarchical clustering revealed the multi-level structure of the dataset, offering insights into the natural groupings present in the radiation data.
