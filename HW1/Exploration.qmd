# **Nuclear Energy Utilization Factor**

## **Data Import and Understanding**

-   **Rows**: Each row corresponds to a different nuclear plant.

-   **Columns**: The columns include the plant's name and its utilization factor for each year from 2013 to 2022.

-   **Data Types**: The "Plant" column is of object data type (string), and the rest of the columns (2013 to 2022) are numerical.

-   **Missing Values**: We need to check for any missing values in the dataset.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore', category=FutureWarning)

# Read in data
nuclear_data = pd.read_csv('../Data/EDA/Nuclear_Energy_Utilization_Factor.csv')

# Checking for missing values
missing_values = nuclear_data.isnull().sum()
print(missing_values)
```

## **Descriptive Statistics**

We will calculate and report the following summary statistics for the numerical variables (utilization factor for the years 2013 to 2022):

-   Mean

-   Median

-   Mode

-   Standard Deviation

-   Variance

```{python}
# Calculating descriptive statistics for the numerical variables
descriptive_stats = nuclear_data.describe(include=[float]).T
descriptive_stats['mode'] = nuclear_data.mode().iloc[0, 1:]
descriptive_stats['variance'] = descriptive_stats['std']**2

# Displaying the descriptive statistics
print(descriptive_stats[['mean', '50%', 'mode', 'std', 'variance']])
```

Here are the descriptive statistics for the nuclear plants' utilization factors from 2013 to 2022:

-   **Mean**: The average utilization factor for each year. It ranges from 90.836 in 2013 to 92.916 in 2019.

-   **Median (50%)**: The middle value of the utilization factor for each year. It ranges from 92.55 in 2013 to 94.40 in 2022.

-   **Mode**: The value that appears most frequently in each year. It varies across years, with some years having more common utilization factors than others.

-   **Standard Deviation (std)**: Measures the amount of variation or dispersion from the average. A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean, while a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range.

-   **Variance**: The square of the standard deviation. It provides a measure of how spread out the values are.

## **Data Visualization**

In this section, we'll create visualizations to further explore the data's distribution, relationships between variables, and potential patterns or trends.

1.  **Histograms**: To visualize the distribution of utilization factors for each year.

2.  **Box Plots**: To observe the spread of the data and identify any potential outliers.

### Histograms

```{python}
# Setting the aesthetic style of the plots
sns.set_style("whitegrid")

# Creating histograms for the utilization factors of each year
fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=3, ncols=4, figsize=(15, 10))

# Flattening the 2D array of axes for easy iteration
axes = axes.flatten()

# Plotting the histograms
for i, year in enumerate(range(2013, 2023)):
    sns.histplot(nuclear_data[str(year)], bins=20, kde=True, ax=axes[i])
    axes[i].set_title(f'Distribution in {year}')
    axes[i].set_xlabel('Utilization Factor')
    axes[i].set_ylabel('Frequency')

# Adjusting layout for better readability
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

The histograms above depict the distribution of utilization factors for each nuclear plant across different years. Here are some observations:

-   The distribution of utilization factors is fairly symmetric in most years, with a slight skewness in some years.

-   The majority of the nuclear plants seem to operate with a high utilization factor, mostly around 90 to 100.

-   There are a few years (e.g., 2016, 2020) where the distribution appears to be more spread out, indicating higher variability in the utilization factors.

### Box Plots

```{python}
fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=3, ncols=4, figsize=(15, 10))

# Flattening the 2D array of axes for easy iteration
axes = axes.flatten()

# Plotting the box plots
for i, year in enumerate(range(2013, 2023)):
    sns.boxplot(x=nuclear_data[str(year)], ax=axes[i])
    axes[i].set_title(f'Box Plot in {year}')
    axes[i].set_xlabel('Utilization Factor')

# Adjusting layout for better readability
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

The box plots above provide a visual representation of the distribution of utilization factors for each year, highlighting the spread of the data and any potential outliers.

-   The median (represented by the line inside the box) is consistently high across all years, mostly above 90.

-   The interquartile range (IQR, represented by the height of the box) is relatively narrow, indicating that the middle 50% of the data points are close to each other.

-   There are some potential outliers in various years, particularly in 2016 and 2020, where the utilization factors are significantly lower than the rest of the data.

## **Correlation Analysis**

```{python}
# Calculating the correlation matrix
correlation_matrix = nuclear_data.iloc[:, 1:].corr()

# Creating a heatmap to visualize the correlation matrix
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, fmt=".2f", cmap="coolwarm", vmin=-1, vmax=1)
plt.title('Correlation Matrix of Utilization Factors (2013-2022)')
plt.show()
```

-   Most of the correlations between different years are positive, suggesting that a higher utilization factor in one year is generally associated with a higher utilization factor in another year.

-   The correlation coefficients are mostly in the range of 0.2 to 0.8, indicating a moderate positive relationship between the years.

-   There are some years with higher correlations to each other (e.g., 2017 and 2019 with a correlation of 0.84), suggesting a stronger relationship in performance between these years.

## **Hypothesis Generation**

Based on the observed patterns and relationships in the data, we might formulate hypotheses such as:

1.  **H1**: The utilization factor of a nuclear plant in one year is positively related to its utilization factor in the subsequent year.

2.  **H2**: There are certain nuclear plants that consistently perform better or worse than others across all years.

3.  **H3**: The variability in utilization factors has decreased or increased over the years.

## **Identifying Outliers**

```{python}
# Calculating the average utilization factor for each nuclear plant over the years
nuclear_data['Average'] = nuclear_data.iloc[:, 1:].mean(axis=1)

# Displaying the nuclear plants sorted by their average utilization factor
sorted_plants = nuclear_data[['Plant', 'Average']].sort_values(by='Average', ascending=False)
print(sorted_plants)
```

### **High Performers:**

The nuclear plants with the highest average utilization factors over the years are:

1.  **Peach Bottom**: 99.24

2.  **Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant**: 98.61

3.  **Dresden Generating Station**: 97.56

4.  **Limerick**: 97.48

5.  **Byron Generating Station**: 97.41

### **Low Performers:**

The nuclear plants with the lowest average utilization factors are:

1.  **Grand Gulf**: 73.88

2.  **Fermi**: 79.67

3.  **Callaway**: 82.47

4.  **Wolf Creek Generating Station**: 84.91

5.  **Arkansas Nuclear One**: 85.13

```{python}
# Defining performance tiers based on the average utilization factor
bins = [0, 80, 90, 95, 100]
labels = ['Low Performer (<80)', 'Below Average (80-90)', 'Above Average (90-95)', 'High Performer (>95)']
nuclear_data['Performance Tier'] = pd.cut(nuclear_data['Average'], bins=bins, labels=labels, right=False)

# Calculating the number of plants in each performance tier
performance_tiers = nuclear_data['Performance Tier'].value_counts().sort_index()

# Displaying the number of plants in each performance tier
print(performance_tiers)
```

The nuclear plants have been categorized into different performance tiers based on their average utilization factor:

1.  **Low Performer (\<80)**: 2 plants

2.  **Below Average (80-90)**: 12 plants

3.  **Above Average (90-95)**: 25 plants

4.  **High Performer (\>95)**: 11 plants

```{python}
# Function to identify outliers using the IQR method
def identify_outliers(data, column):
    Q1 = data[column].quantile(0.25)
    Q3 = data[column].quantile(0.75)
    IQR = Q3 - Q1
    outliers = data[(data[column] < (Q1 - 1.5 * IQR)) | (data[column] > (Q3 + 1.5 * IQR))]
    return outliers[['Plant', column]]

# Identifying outliers for each year
outliers_dict = {}
for year in range(2013, 2023):
    outliers = identify_outliers(nuclear_data, str(year))
    if not outliers.empty:
        outliers_dict[year] = outliers

# Displaying the outliers for each year
print(outliers_dict)
```
